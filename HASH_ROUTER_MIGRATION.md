# HashRouter Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from BrowserRouter to HashRouter to fix white screen issues on Vercel deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. App.tsx
**Before:**
```typescript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { HashRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
```

### 2. vercel.json
**Simplified routing configuration:**
- Removed complex asset routing
- Kept only essential API and catch-all routes
- Reduced configuration complexity

### 3. Removed Files
- `public/_redirects` - No longer needed with HashRouter

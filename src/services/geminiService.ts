‚ö° CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate 10 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT questions from any previous sessions
- RANDOMIZE question types, topics, and complexity levels
- NEVER repeat common or generic questions
- Make each question UNIQUE and FRESH
- Mix different interview styles and approaches

üìã QUESTION MIX (Randomize the distribution):
- Technical/Domain Questions: ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 2} questions
- Behavioral STAR Method: ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 2} questions  
- Situational Problem-Solving: ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 2} questions
- Industry-Specific Scenarios: ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) + 1} questions
- Creative/Innovation Questions: ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) + 1} questions

üé≤ RANDOMIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use random technical concepts and frameworks for ${role}
- Pick random company scenarios and challenges
- Vary question complexity from basic to expert level
- Include different industries and contexts
- Generate questions about emerging trends and technologies
- Create scenario-based questions with random variables

üöÄ ADVANCED REQUIREMENTS FOR ${role.toUpperCase()}:
- Include cutting-edge ${role} technologies and methodologies
- Create questions about real-world ${role} challenges
- Add questions about industry best practices and innovations
- Include team collaboration and leadership scenarios
- Generate questions about problem-solving in complex environments

üí° INNOVATION FACTOR:
- 30% traditional interview questions (but make them unique)
- 40% modern industry-specific challenges
- 20% future-focused and emerging technology questions
- 10% creative problem-solving scenarios

üéØ OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return EXACTLY 10 questions, numbered 1-10, one per line:
1. [Unique question 1]
2. [Unique question 2]
...
10. [Unique question 10]

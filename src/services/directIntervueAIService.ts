Evaluate the following answer to an interview question and give:

1. A score out of 10 for each of the following categories:
   - Correctness (Did the answer reflect accurate and logical understanding?)
   - Relevance (Did it directly answer the question?)
   - Depth & Detail (Was the answer insightful and supported by examples?)
   - Communication (Was it clear, structured, and professional?)

2. Provide overall strengths based on the categories scored above.

3. Point out areas of improvement **only based on weaknesses**.

4. Give a key recommendation based on the overall rating.

5. Detect and include the **word count** and **character count** of the answer.

6. Adapt the tone of your feedback to the overall rating:
   - 1â€“3: Very weak
   - 4â€“6: Needs improvement
   - 7â€“8: Good but can improve
   - 9â€“10: Excellent, near interview-ready (400+ characters, detailed examples, professional)

CONTEXT:
Role: ${role}
Question: "${question}"

User's answer:

DYNAMIC SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 1-3: Very weak (less than 50 characters, no examples, unclear)
- 4-6: Needs improvement (50-200 characters, basic response, minimal detail)
- 7-8: Good but can improve (200-400 characters, good examples, well-structured)
- 9-10: Excellent, near interview-ready (400+ characters, detailed examples, professional)

â€¢ [Specific strength 3 based on the actual answer]

**Areas for Improvement:**
â€¢ [Specific improvement 1 based on actual gaps in the answer]
â€¢ [Specific improvement 2 based on actual gaps in the answer]
â€¢ [Specific improvement 3 based on actual gaps in the answer]

**Key Recommendation:**
[One specific, actionable tip based on the biggest gap identified in this particular answer]

**Detailed Analysis:**
[2-3 sentences providing deeper insight into the answer quality, specific examples of what was good/bad, and how it could be improved]

IMPORTANT: 
- Base your analysis on the ACTUAL content of the answer provided
- Use DYNAMIC scoring based on answer length and quality
- Short answers (less than 50 characters) should get 1-3/10
- Medium answers (50-200 characters) should get 4-6/10
- Long, detailed answers (200+ characters) should get 7-10/10
- Provide RATING-BASED feedback appropriate to the score level`;
